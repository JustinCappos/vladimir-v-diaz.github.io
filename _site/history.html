<p>The basic technology behind TUF was developed at the University of Washington
in 2009 by Justin Samuel and Justin Cappos, and its principles were first
discussed in a paper Samuel and Cappos coauthored with Nick Mathewson and Roger
Dingledine, researchers from <a href="https://www.torproject.org/">The Tor Project,
Inc</a>.  Since 2011, TUF has been based at <a href="http://engineering.nyu.edu/">New York
University Tandon School of Engineering</a>, where
Cappos, working with a team of graduate students and developers, continues to
supervise its development and integration initiatives.</p>

<p>Cappos continued to develop and expand TUF technology when he joined the
faculty of the NYU Tandon School of Engineering in Brooklyn, NY in 2011.
Now a tenured associate professor of computer science and engineering at the
school, he has been assisted in this work by a number of  Ph.D. students,
including Trishank Karthik Kuppusamy, who graduated in 2017, and developers,
including Vladimir Diaz and Sebastien Awwad.</p>

<p>Though TUF technologies have been customized to meet end-user specifications,
four core principles continue to be central to its design.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The first is separation of responsibilities for signing metadata, which means
one compromised key does not automatically compromise all repository users.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second principle specifies a fixed number of signatures, agreeing to what
is present in the metadata that accompanies an update, before the server will
download it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A third principle works to help a repository to recover quickly from a
compromise by providing an automatic way to revoke signing keys. By doing so,
hackers can not sign metadata to authenticate malware.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Lastly, TUF keeps the most vulnerable signing keys offline, which greatly
reduces the risk that they can be stolen or compromised.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In 2016, the TUF research group set up a process whereby the community could
have input on technical issues. Named the TUF Augmentation Proposal, or TAP,
this series of documents also provide information to the TUF community, or
describe new feature for TUF or its processes or environment. Through the use
of TAPs, as well as input from those who adopted the technology, the evolution
of TUF technology can continue as security needs change.</p>
