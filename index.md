The Update Framework (TUF) helps developers secure new or existing software
update systems, which are often found to be vulnerable to many known attacks.
TUF addresses this widespread problem by providing a flexible framework and
specification that developers can adopt with any software update
system.  [Adopters](/adopters.html) have so far implemented the framework in the
Go ([1](https://github.com/theupdateframework/notary),
[2](https://github.com/flynn/go-tuf)),
[Haskell](https://www.well-typed.com/blog/2015/07/hackage-security-alpha/),
[Python](https://github.com/theupdateframework/tuf),
[Ruby](https://medium.com/square-corner-blog/securing-rubygems-with-tuf-part-1-d374fdd05d85),
and [Rust](https://github.com/heartsucker/rust-tuf) programming languages.

TUF is hosted by the [**Cloud Native Computing Foundation**](https://www.cncf.io/)
(CNCF) and follows the [**CNCF Code of
Conduct**](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md).
